    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>PupGo was born from a personal journey across continents, inspired by one unshakable bond — the one between a man and his dog.</p>
    <p>Our founder, Oguzhan Ozdemir, grew up in Istanbul, Türkiye, always dreaming of having a dog. That dream came true in 2020 when he adopted Dagsby — a stubborn, soulful Boxer who quickly became his best friend and family. The early days were tough, but the love grew stronger with each challenge.</p>
    <p>When it came time to travel, Oguzhan realized just how confusing international pet relocation could be — especially for larger dogs. What began as a personal mission to reunite with loved ones without leaving Dagsby behind eventually became a calling.</p>
    <p>Today, PupGo helps pet owners navigate every step of the pet travel process — from paperwork to passports, crates to customs. Whether it's a move across the country or across the world, we’re here to ensure your pet gets there safely, comfortably, and by your side.</p>
